#
#  Welcome to the database.yml file. Here you can setup MySQL to transfer PyroFishing stats
#  between servers. Please read this entire file before setting this up.
#
#  This will NOT transfer all stats to MySQL. The player file is still used to store deliveries.
#  Everything apart from deliveries will transfer across servers. 
#
#  This will never be added as it leads to a whole range of issues with requiring exact configs etc.
#  
#  ! --->
#
#  INSTRUCTIONS FOR MIGRATING: (read notes before starting).
#
#  If you have already been using the plugin and wish to transfer your data to MySQL. Follow these steps:
#  
#  1. Set the use-sql setting to true.
#  2. Ensure your database settings are correct.
#  3. If you have used SQL before migrating, some records may exist in the PyroFishingPro database.
#     Delete all records from SQL, unless some player data will not be migrated over.
#  4. Set 'migrate-yaml-to-sql' to true.
#  5. Start your server.
#  6. Done.
#
#  Note: This will revert the configuration option back to false once completed.
#        Yaml storage will still be used for deliveries, however everything else should be on MySQL.
#
#        Support will NOT be given to help you setup MySQL or resolve issues on your end related to this.
#        You will be expected to sort this yourself as this has nothing to do with the plugin.
#
#        If you have PyroFishingPro data on multiple servers, you will have to pick one to migrate data to.
#        You CANNOT currently migrate multiple data-sets.
